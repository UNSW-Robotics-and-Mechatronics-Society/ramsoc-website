| Camera Power Supply/Charger/Battery        | Must be able to charge the camera.                                               |                                                                         |

| USB Camera                                 | At least 2 would be ideal (1 for casters, 1 for audience/participant reactions). |                                                                         |

| Laptop/Desktop                             | Preferably at least 32 GB RAM.                                                   | 16 GB could still work but you might not be able to do a replay system. |
