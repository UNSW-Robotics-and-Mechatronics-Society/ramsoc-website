# Introduction

This document sets a standard for security measures that should be enacted.

# DO NOT PUSH `.env` and `.dev.vars` FILES TO REPO

They contain sensitive information about the page token that you have generated which could be used maliciously.

If you would like to indicate to contributors what should be in those files provide a template file appended by '.example' instead.

**Do**

Put an example in a file such as `.env.example`.

```bash
SECRET_TOKEN_FOR_MY_API=YOUR_SECRET_HERE;
```

**Don't**

Push `.env` and `.dev.vars` files to our repo especially with the tokens.

```bash
SECRET_TOKEN_FOR_MY_API=AFDacf23dcusa3ihfiaf6Af...;
```

# DO NOT PUSH CODE WITH SENSITIVE DATA TO YOUR BRANCH

Upon a successful push, the CI/CD pipeline will deploy a preview which can be accessed by people with the link to the preview.
