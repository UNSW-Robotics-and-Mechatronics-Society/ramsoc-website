# Email System Documentation

## Introduction

### Background

Our organization historically uses the Gmail account mechatronics.unsw@gmail.com as its primary email address. This account has become deeply integrated into our infrastructure through OAuth authentication with various third-party applications. These applications contain valuable organizational documents and resources.

### Proposed Strategy

To maintain continuity while modernizing our email system, we have implemented an email aliasing solution. The existing Gmail account (mechatronics.unsw@gmail.com) will continue to function under an alias using the format [label]@ramsocunsw.org. This approach preserves our access to connected applications and historical documents while allowing us to transition to a more professional email domain.
This documentation provides comprehensive instructions for:

- Managing email communications using the new infrastructure.
- Configuring new email addresses within our system.
