   - Not actually that important but just good to know.

2. What languages/frameworks do you know?

   - We would prefer those who know the following in this order (these are the only ones used by us):
     - Next.js
     - ReactJS
     - TypeScript
     - JavaScript
     - HTML/CSS/Tailwind
   - Although C, C++, Arduino and ESP32 are not used by IT, they could help with other portfolios.

3. What does the .env file do and why might it important we don't upload it?

   1. A .env file stores environment variables like API keys, credentials, and other sensitive configuration data. It should never be uploaded to version control or shared publicly because:
   2. **Security risk - Exposed credentials could allow unauthorized access to your services**

   - Instead:
     1. Add .env to .gitignore
     2. Provide a .env.example template with dummy values

4. Do you know how to set up live streaming on YouTube?
